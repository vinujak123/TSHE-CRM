## 📈 **Calculated Metrics Explained**

### Conversion Rate
```
Formula: (Total Seekers / Total Reach) × 100

Example:
125 seekers from 50,000 reach
= (125 / 50,000) × 100
= 0.25%

Interpretation:
0.1% - 0.5% = Typical for cold outreach
0.5% - 2.0% = Good performance
2.0%+ = Excellent conversion
```

### Cost Per Seeker
```
Formula: Budget / Total Seekers

Example:
$5,000 budget, 125 seekers
= $5,000 / 125
= $40.00 per seeker

Interpretation:
Lower = More cost effective
Compare across campaigns
Use for budget planning
```

### ROI (Return on Investment)
```
Formula: (Total Interactions / Budget) × 100

Example:
8,900 interactions, $5,000 budget
= (8,900 / 5,000) × 100
= 178%

Interpretation:
>100% = Positive return
Higher = Better performance
Use for budget justification
```

### Engagement Rate
```
Formula: (Total Interactions / Views) × 100

Example:
8,900 interactions, 45,000 views
= (8,900 / 45,000) × 100
= 19.78%

Interpretation:
1% - 3% = Average
3% - 5% = Good
5%+ = Excellent
```
