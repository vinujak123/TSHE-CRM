## 🎯 Quick Examples

### Example 1: Inquiries

**You create 10 inquiries**
- Inquiries page shows: 10 inquiries ✅

**Your colleague creates 15 inquiries**
- You see: Still 10 (not 25) ✅

**Admin views inquiries**
- Admin sees: All 25 inquiries ✅

### Example 2: Dashboard

**Your Stats:**
- Total Seekers: 10
- New This Week: 3
- Pending Tasks: 5

**These are YOUR numbers**

- Just your work
- Your performance

### Example 3: Campaigns Export

**When you click "Export All to Excel":**
- File contains: Your campaigns only ✅
- Not others' campaigns ❌

**When Admin exports:**
- File contains: All campaigns (everyone's) ✅

Your dashboard shows YOUR work, not the team's total.

### Tip 2: Focus on Your Work
You'll only see what you need to work on.

### Tip 3: Admins Monitor All
If you need to see others' data, ask an admin.

### Tip 4: Create Your Own
Start creating inquiries and campaigns to build your dashboard.

### Tip 5: Exports are Yours
When you export, you get YOUR data only (admins get all).
